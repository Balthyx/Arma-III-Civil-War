# Arma-III-Civil-War
Tactical/semi-rp game-mode for Arma III

There is a project for a new game-mod, I want it to be very coop/communication (like Squad).


Semi-rp, Small map for high player density (for 64 player : ~4km², 16 player/km²).

Game duration : 3h ~ 6h.

Points of interest to capture.

### 3 team : 
  - __Government__:
  
    * Must keep control of its territory.
    * Eradicate all the __rebels__.
    * Avoid the loss of __civilians__.

    * A _president / commander_: directs the faction.
    * Two _assistants / ministers_: assist / represent the leader.
    * Two _police_ teams of 6 people.
    * A _military_ team of 6 people.
    
  - __Rebels__: 
  
    * Must capture the territory of the government.
    * Avoid the loss of __civilians__.
    * May carry out civilian spots, but the money earned goes to the faction.

    * A __leader__: leads the faction.
    * The __leader__ organizes the composition of the rest of the team.

  - __Civilians__:
  
    * Survive
    * Earn money by transporting resources.
    * May collaborate with both armed factions to have moare $$ $$ (denunciation, hideouts).

    * The __civilians__ can organize themselves as they want, around the faction they want.

### Special areas:

  * Armurerie: Protected by the __government__, big source of weapons for the __rebels__.
  * Weapons cache: Random spawn at the start of the game, small source of weapons.
  * Industries: source of money for the faction that controls it.
  * Ressources camp: Provided resources for industries.

### Economic system: 

  * Industries provide money when they receive resources.
  * Factions can buy material/weapon/vehicles. (Cheaper for rebels)

### UN:
  * Can militarily intervene against a faction if too many __civil__ murders (a group of ia).
  * Can help a faction by sending weapons, material or money.

### Game flow:

  * __Government__: 
    Begins slightly armed, with some material, 2~3 vehicles.
    Spawn at strategic locations

  * __Rebels__: Spawn mixed with civilians, sometime with a light weapon.

  * __Civilians__: Spawn randomly

  The _rebels_ will have to find money, materials and weapons before starting the rebellion, the beginnings of parties will be calm but   filled with civilian activity.
  Once armed, the _rebels_ will be able to begin rebelliousness, capturing an area or paralising the economy of the _government_.


### Improvements:
  * Prison system
  * Hunger / thirst
